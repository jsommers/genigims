PauseCapture
GetExperimentResults

known bugs and things that need to be improved:

capd_proxy:

- xml/rpc transactions should be over TLS 

- storage thread death -- need to have some tmo to handle uploading
  files some time after capture is shut down for an experiment.

- clean up informational messages sent back to gui to be more informative

- all python code should be converted to use python3, eventually

storage:

- how to best get error messages from storage back to the user, since these all
  happen in an asynchronous fashion?
*FIXED: method getStorageLog in capd_proxy returns the last n storage logs to the user*


capture-daemon:

- changes to handle ipv6

- anonymization testing

- make a set of canned pcap traces to use for regression testing
