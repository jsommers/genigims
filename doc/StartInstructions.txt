To clean everything up (i.e., old storage files, etc.) before a fresh
start, run ./cleanup.sh
   - Note that doing a clean up does *not* remove any log files, so
     you can still inspect the log files to find out what the system
     was doing, even after you clean up any temporary storage files.

To start the capture daemon proxy, just do ./runproxy.sh
   - You'll need to keep the terminal open where you start it.
   - To stop it, just type ^C.
   - It's never a bad idea to type ./cleanup.sh between starts of the
     capture daemon proxy.
   - Once it's started, it should be accessible on TCP port 8001 for
     XML/RPC.
